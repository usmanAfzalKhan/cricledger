## Getting Started

**Requirements**

* Node 20 (I‚Äôm using `20.19.x`)
* npm
* Expo CLI (via `npx expo ...`)

**Install & run**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usmanAfzalKhan/cricledger.git
cd cricledger
npm install

# Dev server (open in Expo Go or an emulator)
npx expo start
# If your network blocks tunnels:
# npx expo start --lan
```

---

## Building an APK (EAS)

I use EAS to generate installable APKs.

1. (First time) Configure EAS:

   ```bash
   npx eas build:configure
   # Choose Android
   ```

2. **Preview APK** build (internal distribution):

   ```bash
   npx --yes eas-cli@latest build -p android --profile preview
   ```

   This uploads and builds on Expo‚Äôs servers. You‚Äôll get a link like:

   ```
   https://expo.dev/accounts/<account>/projects/cricledger/builds/<build-id>
   ```

   Open it and download the APK artifact.

3. **Versioning**

   * App version lives in `app.json` under `"expo.version"`.
   * I typically bump:

     ```json
     {
       "expo": {
         "version": "1.0.1"
       }
     }
     ```
   * For production tracks, manage version codes with EAS (‚Äúremote‚Äù versioning). For preview builds it‚Äôs fine to just bump app version.

> Tip: If icons change, rebuild (Android caches launcher icons per install).

## Releases on GitHub

How I publish for friends/clients to download:

1. Build an APK with EAS (see above).
2. Rename it to something friendly, e.g. `cricledger-1.0.1.apk`.
3. Create a **GitHub Release**:

   * Go to **Releases** ‚Üí **Draft a new release**
   * Tag: `v1.0.1` (or whatever version)
   * Title: `CricLedger 1.0.1`
   * Attach the APK as a binary asset
   * Publish
4. Share the Releases page or direct APK link.

## Privacy

* No analytics, no trackers, no ads.
* Everything is local to the device.
* Sharing a summary (PDF/TXT) uses the system share sheet.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Expo tunnel error** (`ngrok` took too long):

  * Use `npx expo start --lan` and connect on the same Wi-Fi.

* **‚ÄúCannot find native module 'ExponentImagePicker' / 'ExpoPrint'‚Äù** in dev:

  * Make sure these are installed (they are in `package.json`).
  * If you edited dependencies, do a clean install:

    ```
    rm -rf node_modules
    npm install
    ```
  * In Expo Go, only *managed* API modules work. For bare/prebuild native changes you need a dev client build, but this project sticks to managed-friendly modules.

* **Icons didn‚Äôt update on device:**

  * Uninstall the previous APK from the phone, then install the new one (launcher icons are cached per package).

---

## Roadmap / Ideas

* Per-player advanced stats (fours/sixes, maidens, etc.)
* Multi-match history on device
* Export/import match JSON
* Tablet UI polish
